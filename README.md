# Social Network API
By Valeria Alarcon
Module 18 Challenge - NoSQL: Social Network API



## User Story
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```



## Description
This module challenge asks us to build an API for a social network web aplication where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. This API uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB for databases, and the Mongoose ODM. To demonstrate and test the functionality of this API, I've used Insomnia. Below, you will find a demo video of the API I created on VS code using Insomnia.

## Usage
To use this API, you must follow these steps:
1. Install any and all necessary packages and dependencies using the command ``npm i``
2. Initialize the API by running the command ``npm run start``
